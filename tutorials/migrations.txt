HOW TO MAKE MIGRATIONS:
1. Open PG ADMIN
2. Delete the table that you want to modify
3. Delete all rows from django_migrations table where app is "data_entry"
SQL for that: 
DELETE FROM django_migrations WHERE app = 'data_entry';
4. Delete all files and folders inside the migrations folder inside data_entry folder
5. Enter the following command to the command line (this is for windows. Linux or Mac will vary)
py manage.py makemigrations data_entry
6. enter the following command to the command line (this is for windows. Linux or Mac will vary)
py manage.py migrate data_entry
7. Refresh pgadmin and check if tables are updated
